```

### If you're getting an error like `sudo: python: command not found`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trakBan/spongebob-cli.git; cd spongebob-cli; chmod +x spongebob-cli; sudo python3 setup.py install
```

#### Gentoo users:
Gentoo users have to add --user when they are installing with setup.py
Run this instead:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trakBan/spongebob-cli.git; cd spongebob-cli; chmod +x spongebob-cli; python3 setup.py install --user
```

### If the video won't play
- Check if you have mpv and youtube-dl installed.
    - You can also install `youtube-dl` through your package manager if `setup.py` did not install it correctly
- If you don't have youtube-dl but a fork of it, make an alias in your ~./bashrc file and alias it to youtube-dl
